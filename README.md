# Generalised Political Scaling

This repository contains replication data and code for the research paper *A Generalised Approach to Scaling Political Actors with Embedding Representations*, written as my master's thesis @ [SODAS, UCPH](https://sodas.ku.dk/).

For further documentation of data collection, please refer to the [data collection repo](https://github.com/mathiasbruun/DCPA).

Embeddings are too large to upload here. They will be hosted elsewhere.
