# Generalised Political Scaling

This repository contains replication data and code for the research paper *A Generalised Approach to Scaling Political Actors with Embedding Representations*, written as my master's thesis @ [SODAS, UCPH](https://sodas.ku.dk/).

Embeddings are too large to upload here. They are hosted on Git LFS.
